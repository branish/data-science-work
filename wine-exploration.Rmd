## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load-csv}
filename <- "./data/cellrtracker_top500_by_rating.csv"

## Load the data
df_cellartracker <-
  read_csv(filename, col_names = c('name', 'vintage', 'searchrank', 'avgrating', 'price'))
df_cellartracker

df_cellartracker %>%
  separate(col = name, into = c('winename', 'loc'), sep = ', ', extra = 'merge') %>%
  separate(col = loc, into = c('region', 'country'), sep = ', ', fill = 'left') %>%
  mutate(
    rating_100 = str_extract(avgrating, '^(\\d+)'),
    price = as.integer(str_remove_all(price, '[\\$,]')),
    searchrank = as.integer(str_remove_all(searchrank, '\\D')))



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
